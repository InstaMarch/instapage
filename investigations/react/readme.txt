Summary
--
This project describes a native (vanilla) JavaScript implementation
of the React framework. It is based off of David Gilbertson's 
excellent article:

https://hackernoon.com/how-i-converted-my-react-app-to-vanillajs-and-whether-or-not-it-was-a-terrible-idea-4b14b1b2faff

We have modified some of the concepts-
- Instead of using jsdom, we send an app.html file
- We provide a simple data persistence model

Concept
--
A. Nested objects created from document.createElement and 
 objects acting as DOM elements
 
B.
